## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security Considerations:
- Change default passwords before production
- Set up SSH key authentication
- Configure proper SSL certificates
- Review firewall rules for your environment

### Backup Verification:
- Test restoration procedures regularly
- Verify backup integrity monthly
- Monitor backup storage space
- Document recovery procedures

### Monitoring Setup:
- Configure notification channels (email, Slack, Discord)
- Set appropriate alert thresholds
- Create status pages for stakeholders
- Schedule regular monitoring reviews
